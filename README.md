  Just type the command as you would in your terminal (e.g., `ls`, `dir`, `python script.py`).

- **To ask the AI a question:**
  Prefix your input with `?` or `ai`, or simply type a natural language question (e.g., `? How do I use git rebase?`).

- **Error detection:**
  If a command fails, TerminalAI will offer to explain the error and suggest a fix using the AI.

- **Exit:**
  Type `exit` or `quit` to leave the program.
